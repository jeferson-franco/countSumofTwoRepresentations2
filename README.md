# countSumofTwoRepresentations2

Given integers `n`, `l` and `r`, find the number of ways to represent `n` as a sum of two integers `A` and `B` such that `l ≤ A ≤ B ≤ r`.

## Example

For `n = 6`, `l = 2`, and `r = 4`, the output should be
`solution(n, l, r) = 2`.

There are just two ways to write `6` as `A + B`, where `2 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 4`: `6 = 2 + 4` and `6 = 3 + 3`.

## Input/Output

- [execution-time-limit] 4 seconds (js)

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
`5 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.

- [input] integer l

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
`1 ≤ l ≤ r`.

- [input] integer r

A positive integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
`l ≤ r ≤ 10^9`,
`r - l ≤ 10^6`.

- [output] integer
